# University of Texas at San Antonio - Intel Processor Database Project
CS 3743: Database Systems (Dr. Kirsten Webbe)  

For our project, we propose to make a database for Wikipedia that tracks the improvements
intel has made in their main 4 streamline processors, the intel® Core™ i3, i5, i7, and i9. Our
rationale for this project is to see if Moore's law still holds up to this day. Moore's Law states that
the number of transistors on a microchip doubles every two years. The law claims that we can
expect the speed and capability of our computers to increase every two years because of this,
yet we will pay less for them. This database aims to answer this by displaying how the
specifications of intel processors have changed over time. This is perfect for Wikipedia because
processors and technology is always changing, so Wikipedia has the ability to stay up to date
for this kind of information.  

We chose to only look at intel processors due to their leading market share in the computer
processor industry. Today, the mainstream Intel® Core™ processor series includes the brand
modifiers i3, i5, i7, and i9. Higher brand modifier numbers offer a higher level of performance
and, in some cases, additional features like hyper-threading technology or integrated graphics.
Additionally, narrowing it down to these four brand modifiers will relate to what most customers
in the processor market will purchase.  

The data we will gather for our database will include thread count, cache size, core count,
core architecture, core fabrication, bus speed, and production date. These specifications will be
based on the first through most recent intel® Core processors, spanning between 2010 and
2023. We will be getting the data through the internet, especially using Intel’s website, which
contains specifications for every intel processor ever made. Through providing this database on
Wikipedia, we will show the public if the advancements in processors align with Moore's law.
Business Description  

Wikipedia is a non-profit free-content online encyclopedia written and maintained by a
community of volunteers. Wikipedia is very popular and accessible as it is the first page of
Google search results more than 50% of the time. Additionally, Wikipedia promotes a
commitment to evidence-based and up-to-date information, which helps maintain the integrity
and accuracy of its content. Much of the data that makes up the Wikipedia encyclopedia is
actually stored in a SQL database. While traditional encyclopedias might be revised annually,
Wikipedia's database of articles, is updated thousands of times an hour. This is a big deal for
technology, recent science, or any other field that changes rapidly.  

# Business Rules  
1. Information added to Wikipedia must be verifiable and based on reliable sources.
2. Wikipedia aims to present information in a balanced and unbiased manner. So data
must be unbiased, and should include and represent statistics fairly.
3. Wikipedia will employ a version control system to track changes.
4. Content on Wikipedia that does not meet notability or quality standards may be
nominated for deletion.
5. Wikipedia's content will be licensed under Creative Commons licenses, allowing for
reuse with proper attribution.
6. Content on Wikipedia has a unique permanent URL, ensuring that specific versions
can be referenced reliably.
7. Any data added will be publicly and permanently available to EVERYONE.
8. Every piece of information added to Wikipedia should be accompanied by citations to
reliable sources.
9. Wikipedia is not a platform for publishing original research or personal opinions.
Information should be based on previously published sources rather than personal
interpretations or observations.
10. Wikipedia relies on a community of dedicated editors who can monitor recent changes
for vandalism or improper edits. Vandalism of content is not permitted.
