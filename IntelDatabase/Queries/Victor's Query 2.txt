Victor's Query 2

--Query that Shows Processors with integrated graphics to avoid
--Query returns processors with igpu, generation older than 9, and series below 7. Processors are older and more likely to not meet system requirements for newer software
--ordered by cpu base clock speed, igpu speed, and series version
