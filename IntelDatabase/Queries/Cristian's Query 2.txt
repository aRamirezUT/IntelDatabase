-- This query can be used to determine the fastest processor available for each series
-- Displays the highest end processor for each generation based on cache size, and Core Count
-- Relevance : Example for the ASUS Prime Z390 motherboard (Intel 8th Gen) the fastest compatible processors are the 8350k, 8400, 8700
